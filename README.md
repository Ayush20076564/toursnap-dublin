# TourSnap-App
A simple Ionic + Angular travel companion app that lets users browse places, view place details, and create/edit offline journal entries with notes and photos. It includes a clean UI with modal-based entry viewing, safe navigation between pages, and local storage/file saving so the journal works even without internet.
